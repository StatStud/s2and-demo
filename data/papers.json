      "abstract": "We present a new approach to transfer learning for natural language processing. Our approach leverages a large amount of available paired data and multi-task learning to train a unified text-to-text transformer (T5) model that can perform a variety of NLP tasks, including language understanding, language generation, question answering, and summarization. We evaluate our model on a wide range of benchmarks and show that it achieves state-of-the-art results on many tasks, while requiring significantly less task-specific training data compared to task-specific models.",

We investigate how the chatbot can be personalized to the individual user, and how the user's engagement and satisfaction with the chatbot evolve over time. Our results suggest that personalization can improve user engagement and satisfaction, and that the chatbot can be a useful tool for language learning.",
