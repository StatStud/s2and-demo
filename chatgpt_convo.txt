Author Disambiguation Demo

user: I want to create a demo data for author disambiguation. We will 
create two files called "papers.json" and "signatures.json". For this 
prompt, let's focus on papers.json only. Below I have provided an example 
output for one record. Make this a json of json objects, where the key is 
an incremental integer, starting from 0, and the values to this key are 
paper_id (which equals the value of the key), title, abstract, 
journal_name, venue, year, references (which points to a list of other 
paper_ids), and authors (which contains the author_name and the position 
(an integer value, starting from 0). Create 3 such records, and make them 
diverse, while including the possibility for author disambiguation task.

Here is a sample for one record of papers.json:

"15718873": {
        "paper_id": 15718873,
        "title": "A predictive empirical model for pricing and resource 
allocation decisions",
        "abstract": "We present a semi-parametric model that describes 
pricing behaviors in a market environment, and we show how that model can 
be used to guide resource allocation and pricing decisions in an 
autonomous trading agent. We validate our model by presenting experimental 
results obtained in the Trading Agent Competition for Supply Chain 
Management.",

user: Now write a python function to collect (1) all the author_names (2) 
all the unique author_names
assistant: Sure, here's a Python function that collects all the 
author_names and unique author_names from the papers.json file:

```python
import json

def collect_authors(file_path):
    with open(file_path) as f:
        papers = json.load(f)
    
    author_names = []
    for paper_id, paper in papers.items():
        authors = paper['authors']
        for author in authors:
            author_names.append(author['author_name'])

    unique_author_names = list(set(author_names))

    return author_names, unique_author_names
```

The function takes a file_path argument, which is the path to the 
papers.json file. It loads the file using the `json.load()` method, and 
then iterates through all the papers, collecting the author names for each 
paper. The function then creates a set of unique author names using the 
`set()` function, and converts it back to a list using `list()`. Finally, 
the function returns both the list of author names and the list of unique 
author names.

You can call this function like this:

```python
author_names, unique_author_names = collect_authors('papers.json')
print(author_names)
print(unique_author_names)
``` 

This will print out the list of all author names and the list of unique 
author names in the papers.json file.
user: Now let's shift towards generating the signatures.json.  Below I 
have provided an example output for one record. Make this a json of json 
objects, where the key is an incremental integer, starting from 0, and the 
values to this key are signature_id (which equals the value of the key), 
author_id (a random, non-duplicate integer), paper_id (integer value, 
between 0 and 5), and author_info. 

Write a function that will parse each record of papers.json, and create a 
record similar to the one below for each author. Be sure to update the 
position value to reflect the position form the paper.json. Also, make the 
"given_block" and "block" fields to be the the lowercase string 
concatenation of (1) the first initial of the first name (2) the full last 
name.

"102": {
        "author_id": 7362182,
        "paper_id": 34892010,
        "signature_id": "102",
        "author_info": {
            "given_block": "b wilkinson",
            "block": "b wilkinson",
            "position": 0,
            "first": "Barry",
            "middle": null,
            "last": "Wilkinson",
            "suffix": null,
            "affiliations": [
                "University of North Carolina at Charlotte"
            ],
            "email": null
        }
    },
assistant: Here's a function that takes in the papers dictionary and 
returns a signatures dictionary:

```python
import random

def generate_signatures(papers):
    signatures = {}
    author_id_set = set()
    for paper_id, paper in papers.items():
        for author in paper['authors']:
            author_id = random.randint(1000000, 9999999)
            while author_id in author_id_set:
                author_id = random.randint(1000000, 9999999)
            author_id_set.add(author_id)
            signature_id = len(signatures)
            given_block = author['author_name'].split()[0][0].lower()
            last_name = author['author_name'].split()[-1].lower()
            block = given_block + ' ' + last_name
            author_info = {
                'given_block': given_block + ' ' + last_name,
                'block': block,
                'position': author['position'],
                'first': author['author_name'].split()[0],
                'middle': ' '.join(author['author_name'].split()[1:-1]) or 
None,
                'last': last_name,
                'suffix': None,
                'affiliations': [],
                'email': None
            }
            signatures[str(signature_id)] = {
                'author_id': author_id,
                'paper_id': int(paper_id),
                'signature_id': str(signature_id),
                'author_info': author_info
            }
    return signatures
```

This function generates a random `author_id` for each author and ensures 
that the IDs are unique. It then iterates over each paper and each author 
within the paper, generates a unique `signature_id`, and creates the 
`author_info` dictionary using the author's name and position from the 
paper. Finally, it adds the signature to the `signatures` dictionary using 
the generated IDs and information.
user: Update this function so that the input is a json file
assistant: Sure, here's an updated version of the function that takes in 
the path to the `papers.json` file as an input:

```python
import json

def generate_signatures_from_papers(papers_file_path):
    with open(papers_file_path) as f:
        papers = json.load(f)
    
    signatures = {}
    author_id = 0
    for paper_id, paper_info in papers.items():
        for author_info in paper_info['authors']:
            given_block = author_info['author_name'].split()[0][0].lower()
            last_name = author_info['author_name'].split()[-1].lower()
            block = given_block + ' ' + last_name
            position = author_info['position']
            author = {
                "given_block": given_block,
                "block": block,
                "position": position,
                "first": author_info['author_name'].split()[0],
                "middle": None,
                "last": last_name.capitalize(),
                "suffix": None,
                "affiliations": [],
                "email": None
            }
            signature_id = str(len(signatures))
            signatures[signature_id] = {
                "signature_id": signature_id,
                "author_id": author_id,
                "paper_id": paper_id,
                "author_info": author
            }
            author_id += 1
    
    return signatures
```

To use this function, you can call it like this:

```python
signatures = generate_signatures_from_papers('papers.json')
```
user: Now make sure that the function writes the signatures variable to a 
json file called "signatues.json"
assistant: Sure, here's an updated version of the function that writes the 
signatures to a JSON file:

```python

        papers = json.load(f)

    authors = set()

    for paper_id, paper in papers.items():
        for author in paper['authors']:
            author_id = random.randint(1, 10000000)
            authors.add(author['author_name'])
            signature_id = len(signatures)
            author_info = {
                'given_block': author['author_name'].split()[0][0].lower() 
+ ' ' + author['author_name'].split()[-1].lower(),
                'block': author['author_name'].split()[-1].lower(),
                'position': author['position'],
                'first': author['author_name'].split()[0],
                'middle': None,

This function will create a file called "signatures.json" in the same 
directory as the python script, containing the generated signatures.
